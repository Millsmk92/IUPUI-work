/* I want to create a simple program that takes a user input(named userInput)
and multiplies the userInput by 5 when a button is pressed. Then I would like for the result be returned to the DOM
using a getElementById for the output as well as the input. */

<p>Click the button to multiply your number by 5.</p>
<input id="userNumber"/>
<button onclick="multiply()">Try it</button>

function multiply() {
  var x = document.getElementById("userNumber").innerHTML *5;
  document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = x;
